# SHAP Explainability for Time Series Anomaly Detection

This is a **demonstration repository** inspired by a real-world project involving anomaly detection in sequential signal data.  
All code and data here are synthetic, created solely for demonstration purposes.

## 🚀 Features
- CNN and LSTM-based sequence modeling for anomaly detection
- Ensemble classifier integration
- SHAP-based explainability for model transparency
- Workflow designed for regulatory readiness

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python, PyTorch
- SHAP, Scikit-learn
- Docker (for containerization)
- AWS (deployment-ready pipeline)

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- How to structure a time series classification pipeline
- How to apply SHAP for explainability in sequence models
- How to package ML workflows for deployment

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This repository does **not** contain any proprietary code, datasets, or domain-specific parameters from the original project.  
All examples and datasets are artificially generated.
